First, who even *is* MESA? Not many people may know him, but he has been making music since 2013, with different aliases and stage names. MESA makes electronic dance music: future bass, tropical house, and so on. MESA has released just one track at the time of writing, a house track named *Home*.

MESA is a big fan of Chorale. Not only was MESA glad that I got in touch with him. Oh, and in case you are wondering, I met MESA on the [Monstercat Discord](https://discord.gg/Monstercat). On that Discord, he was sharing previews and work-in-progress snippets of his songs. (You could do the same.)

MESA is currently working a new future bass track, which is estimated to drop sometime this fall. And, of course, you will be able to listen to it on Chorale.
