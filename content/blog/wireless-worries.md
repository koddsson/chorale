title: Wireless worries in the world of no headphone jacks
description: It seems like after Apple ditched the headphone jack, everyone else is following suit. Google is rumored to ditch the 3.5mm jack on the upcoming Pixel 2, and the newly released Essential Phone has no jack either…

First off, have you considered purchasing wireess headphones? If your old bunch are reaching their end of life, maybe it is time for an upgrade. I recommend checking out [/r/headphones](https://reddit.com/r/headphones) for help on choosing the best pair of headphones, those guys are serious audiophiles, unlike me.

Next, let’s consider the cold, hard reality we’re currently facing. Not every smartphone manufacturer is ditching the jack just yet. You can give Samsung props, for example. Not Google though. Nor Essential. Apple obviously started this crap so you can’t give them props either. Anyway, back to the topic at hand: vote with your wallet! That’s the most important thing. Companies won’t listen until it affects their bottom line. Of course, it could *also* mean that the phone doesn’t have some super cool feature and they don’t listen to the consumers, but that’s up to the OEMs.

Also, consider my situation: I listen to music from my speakers. Desktop speakers. Set the stereo to 100%, everything else to mute, and let my music app play at 15%. I can control the volume and tracks from my phone in bed. It’s a lovely solution, which is how I’m using the Spotify Free edition right now to circumvent the restrictions of the free plan.

But, if you need a shiny Apple device, then just use an adapter that came with your phone or buy one so you can charge & listen at the same time. This option is costly, but also practical. Surrendering is fun, isn’t it? You could go cry because this is making you stressed and you just want to listen to [something](/blog/the-first-of-the-many/) without reading an overly complicated tech article, of course, but nothing is life is simple.
